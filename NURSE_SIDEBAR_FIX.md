# 🔧 Nurse Sidebar Fix - Issue Resolved

## ❌ **The Problem:**

The nurse sidebar wasn't appearing on all pages because:

1. **Wrong Route Nesting**: Nurse routes were nested inside `MainLayout` instead of being at the top level
2. **Wrong Protection Pattern**: ProtectedRoute was wrapping the layout instead of individual routes

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
<Route element={<MainLayout />}>  // ← Wrong parent!
  <Route element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['NURSE']}>
      <NurseLayout />  // ← Protection in wrong place
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }>
    <Route path="/nurse-dashboard" element={<NurseDashboard />} />
    // ... more routes
  </Route>
</Route>
```

## ✅ **The Solution:**

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Moved outside MainLayout, at same level as DoctorLayout
<Route element={<NurseLayout />}>
  <Route path="/nurse-dashboard" element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['NURSE']}>
      <NurseDashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
  <Route path="/nurse-appointments" element={
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['NURSE']}>
      <NurseAppointments />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
  // ... all routes protected individually
</Route>
```

## 🎯 **What Changed:**

1. **Moved nurse routes** from inside `MainLayout` to top level (line 351-393)
2. **Changed protection pattern** to match doctor routes:
   - ProtectedRoute now wraps each individual route component
   - NurseLayout is the parent route element (no protection wrapper)
3. **Same structure as DoctorLayout** for consistency

## 📊 **Route Hierarchy Now:**

```
App
├── MainLayout (Admin routes)
├── NurseLayout (Nurse routes) ← Fixed!
│   ├── /nurse-dashboard
│   ├── /nurse-appointments
│   ├── /nurse-patients
│   ├── /nurse-tasks
│   ├── /nurse-medical-records
│   ├── /nurse-messages
│   ├── /nurse-profile
│   └── /nurse-settings
├── DoctorLayout (Doctor routes)
└── PatientLayout (Patient routes)
```

## ✨ **Result:**

The **NurseSidebar and NurseHeader now appear on ALL nurse pages** consistently!

### **Test It:**
1. Login as nurse: `mary.johnson@hospital.com` / `nurse123`
2. Navigate to any nurse page
3. Sidebar should be visible on every page ✅

## 🔍 **Why This Works:**

- **NurseLayout** wraps all nurse routes as a parent
- Each child route renders inside the `<Outlet />` in NurseLayout
- Sidebar and header are part of NurseLayout, so they appear on all pages
- Individual route protection ensures only nurses can access

---

**Status: ✅ FIXED**

The sidebar now appears consistently across all nurse pages!
