## 🧪 How to Test

### **Test Facility-Based Filtering**:

1. **Login as a Patient** who is registered at a specific facility
2. **Go to "Book Appointment"**
3. **Select "Doctor"** as staff type
4. **You should only see doctors** assigned to your facility!

### **Example Test Scenario**:

**If you're a patient at "Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital"**:
- You'll see doctors assigned to that hospital ✅
- You won't see doctors from other hospitals ❌

---

## 🎯 What's Working

### ✅ **Backend**:
- Doctors stored in MongoDB with `facilityIds` array
- API endpoint `/api/users/add-staff` accepts facility assignments
- Filtering endpoint `/api/users?role=staff&facilityIds=X` works

### ✅ **Frontend**:
- BookAppointment component passes patient's `facilityIds` to API
- Only shows doctors from patient's facilities
- Specialization-based grouping works

### ✅ **Database**:
- 5 doctors with facility assignments
- 55 facilities available
- Proper MongoDB relationships

## 📝 Next Steps

### **Option 1: Test the System**
Login as a patient and try booking an appointment to see the facility filtering in action!

### **Option 2: Add More Doctors**

  "role": "DOCTOR",
  "specialization": "Cardiology",
  "licenseNumber": "MP999999",
  "facilityIds": ["facility_id_1", "facility_id_2"]
}
```

### **Option 3: Update Existing Doctors**
If you need to change a doctor's facility assignments:

```bash
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/users/<doctor_id>
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

{
  "facilityIds": ["new_facility_id_1", "new_facility_id_2"]
