# üè• Facility Setup Guide

## Quick Start: Adding Facilities to Your Database

### üöÄ Method 1: Seed Pre-configured Facilities (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to use the pre-configured South African facilities:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/seedFacilities.js
```

**What you get:**
- ‚úÖ 55+ South African healthcare facilities
- ‚úÖ Facilities across all 9 provinces
- ‚úÖ Hospitals, clinics, and community health centers
- ‚úÖ Complete facility information (address, phone, email)

**Output:**
```

## ‚ûï Adding Your Own Custom Facilities

### Option 1: Via API (Postman/Thunder Client)

**Step 1: Login as Admin**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@hospital.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```

**Step 2: Add Facility**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/facilities
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Your Hospital Name",
  "type": "HOSPITAL",
  "address": "123 Main Street, City, Postal Code",
  "province": "Gauteng",
  "district": "Johannesburg",
  "phone": "+27 11 123 4567",
  "email": "info@yourhospital.com",
  "website": "https://www.yourhospital.com",
  "services": ["Emergency", "Surgery", "Pediatrics"]
}
```

### Option 2: Direct MongoDB Insert

Using MongoDB Compass or shell:

```javascript
db.facilities.insertOne({
  name: "Your Hospital Name",
  type: "HOSPITAL",
  address: "123 Main Street, City, Postal Code",
  province: "Gauteng",
  district: "Johannesburg",
  phone: "+27 11 123 4567",
  email: "info@yourhospital.com",
  website: "https://www.yourhospital.com",
  services: ["Emergency", "Surgery", "Pediatrics"],
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

### Option 3: Create a Custom Seed Script

Create `backend/scripts/seedMyFacilities.js`:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Facility = require('../models/Facility');

const myFacilities = [
  {
    name: "My Hospital 1",
    type: "HOSPITAL",
    address: "Address 1",
    province: "Gauteng",
    district: "Johannesburg",
    phone: "+27 11 111 1111",
    email: "hospital1@example.com"
  },
  {
    name: "My Clinic 1",
    type: "CLINIC",
    address: "Address 2",
    province: "Gauteng",
    district: "Johannesburg",
    phone: "+27 11 222 2222",
    email: "clinic1@example.com"
  }
];

async function seedMyFacilities() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/hospital_management');
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
    
    const inserted = await Facility.insertMany(myFacilities);
    console.log(`‚úÖ Added ${inserted.length} facilities`);
    
    await mongoose.connection.close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

seedMyFacilities();
```

Run it:
```bash
node backend/scripts/seedMyFacilities.js
```

## üìã Facility Types

Choose the appropriate type for your facility:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `HOSPITAL` | General hospitals | Chris Hani Baragwanath |
| `CLINIC` | Community clinics | Local health clinic |
| `CHC` | Community Health Centers | District CHC |
| `ACADEMIC` | Teaching hospitals | Charlotte Maxeke |
| `DISTRICT` | District hospitals | District Hospital |
| `PROVINCIAL` | Provincial hospitals | Provincial Hospital |
| `PRIVATE` | Private hospitals | Netcare, Life Healthcare |

---

## üîç Viewing Facilities

### Via API
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/facilities
```

### Via MongoDB Compass
1. Connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`
2. Open `hospital_management` database
3. View `facilities` collection

### Via MongoDB Shell
```javascript
use hospital_management
db.facilities.find().pretty()

// Count facilities
db.facilities.countDocuments()

// Find by province
db.facilities.find({ province: "Gauteng" })

// Find by type
db.facilities.find({ type: "HOSPITAL" })
```

---

## üîó Linking Doctors to Facilities

After adding facilities, you need to assign doctors to them:

### Method 1: Use the Add Doctors Script
```bash
# Edit addDoctorsNow.js to use your facility IDs
node addDoctorsNow.js
```

### Method 2: Via API
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/users/add-staff
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

{
  "name": "Dr. John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@hospital.com",
  "role": "DOCTOR",
  "specialization": "Cardiology",
  "licenseNumber": "MP123456",
  "facilityIds": ["YOUR_FACILITY_ID_1", "YOUR_FACILITY_ID_2"]
}
```

### Method 3: Update Existing Doctor
```bash
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/users/{doctorId}
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>

{
  "facilityIds": ["YOUR_FACILITY_ID_1", "YOUR_FACILITY_ID_2"]
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing Facility Setup

### 1. Verify Facilities Were Added
```bash
# Check count
curl http://localhost:5000/api/facilities | jq 'length'

# View all facilities
curl http://localhost:5000/api/facilities | jq '.'
```

### 2. Test Facility-Based Filtering
1. Create/update a patient with a facility assignment
2. Login as that patient
3. Go to "Book Appointment"
4. Select "Doctor"
5. You should only see doctors from that facility

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No facilities found"
**Solution**: Run the seed script:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/seedFacilities.js
```

### Problem: "Duplicate key error"
**Solution**: Facilities already exist. Either:
- Skip seeding (facilities are already there)
- Clear and re-seed:
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell
db.facilities.deleteMany({})
// Then run seed script again
```

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check connection string in `.env`
- For Atlas, verify network access

## üìä Facility Data Structure

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Hospital Name",
  type: "HOSPITAL",
  address: "Full address",
  province: "Province name",
  district: "District name",
  phone: "+27 XX XXX XXXX",
  email: "contact@hospital.com",
  website: "https://hospital.com",
  services: ["Emergency", "Surgery"],
  createdAt: ISODate("..."),
  updatedAt: ISODate("...")
}
```

## ‚úÖ Checklist

After setting up facilities:

- [ ] Facilities seeded successfully
- [ ] Facilities visible via API
- [ ] Doctors assigned to facilities
- [ ] Patients assigned to facilities
- [ ] Facility-based filtering tested
- [ ] Appointment booking works correctly

---

## üéØ Next Steps

After adding facilities:

1. **Add Doctors**: Assign doctors to your facilities
   ```bash
   node addDoctorsNow.js
   ```

2. **Assign Patients**: Link patients to facilities
   ```bash
   node assignFacilityToPatient.js
   ```

3. **Test Filtering**: Verify facility-based doctor filtering works

4. **Add More Data**: Add nurses, appointments, etc.
