# Problem Statement: Hospital Management System

## Background
Many hospitals and healthcare facilities currently rely on manual, paper-based systems or fragmented digital solutions to manage their day-to-day operations. These systems are often inefficient, error-prone, and unable to keep up with the increasing demands of modern healthcare.

## Current System/Structure
The existing system in most hospitals involves:
- Manual registration of patients using paper forms.
- Physical storage of medical records, which are prone to loss or damage.
- Appointment scheduling done via phone calls or in-person, leading to double bookings or missed appointments.
- Communication between doctors, nurses, and patients is often informal and lacks a centralized platform.
- Billing and inventory management are handled separately, increasing administrative overhead.

## Challenges with the Current System
1. **Inefficiency:** Manual processes are time-consuming and lead to delays in patient care and administrative tasks.
2. **Data Inaccuracy:** Human errors in data entry and record-keeping can compromise patient safety and service quality.
3. **Lack of Integration:** Disconnected systems make it difficult to access comprehensive patient information quickly.
4. **Security Risks:** Paper records and unprotected digital files are vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
5. **Difficulty in Communication:** Lack of a unified communication channel among staff and patients leads to miscommunication and operational bottlenecks.
6. **Limited Reporting:** Generating reports and analytics for decision-making is cumbersome and often inaccurate.

## Purpose of the Hospital Management System
To address these challenges, this Hospital Management System was developed to:
- Digitize and centralize patient records and hospital operations.
- Improve efficiency, accuracy, and security of healthcare data.
- Enhance communication among healthcare providers and patients.
- Simplify appointment scheduling, billing, and reporting processes.
- Provide a scalable solution adaptable to the evolving needs of healthcare facilities.
