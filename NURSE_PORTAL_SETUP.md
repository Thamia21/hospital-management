# 🏥 Nurse Portal - Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ Consistent Sidebar Navigation

The nurse portal now has a **consistent sidebar across all pages** using the NurseLayout wrapper.

### 📱 **All Nurse Routes with Sidebar:**

All these routes now display the professional gradient sidebar and header:

- `/nurse-dashboard` - Dashboard with stats and today's schedule
- `/nurse-appointments` - Full appointment management
- `/nurse-patients` - Patient list
- `/nurse-tasks` - Task management
- `/nurse-medical-records` - Medical records access
- `/nurse-messages` - Messaging system
- `/nurse-profile` - Profile management
- `/nurse-settings` - Settings and preferences

### 🎨 **Sidebar Features:**

- **Professional Design**: Gradient background matching doctor portal
- **User Profile**: Shows nurse avatar, name, and role
- **Navigation Menu**: 6 main menu items
- **Bottom Menu**: Profile, Settings, Logout
- **Active State**: Highlights current page
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions on hover
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

#### **NurseLayout Component:**
```javascript
<Box sx={{ display: 'flex', minHeight: '100vh' }}>
  <NurseHeader />
  <NurseSidebar />
  <Box component="main">
    <Toolbar />
    <Outlet /> {/* Child routes render here */}
  </Box>
</Box>
```

#### **Route Structure in App.jsx:**
```javascript
<Route element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['NURSE']}>
    <NurseLayout />
  </ProtectedRoute>
}>
  {/* All nurse routes nested here */}
  <Route path="/nurse-dashboard" element={<NurseDashboard />} />
  <Route path="/nurse-appointments" element={<NurseAppointments />} />
  {/* ... more routes */}
</Route>
```

### 🚀 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Removed Duplicate Routes**: Old `/tasks` and `/medical-records` routes without sidebar were removed
2. **Consistent Layout**: All nurse routes now use NurseLayout
3. **Proper Navigation**: Sidebar links point to correct nurse-prefixed routes
4. **Role-Based Access**: All routes protected with NURSE role requirement

3. **NurseLayout.jsx** - Wrapper that combines sidebar + header + content
