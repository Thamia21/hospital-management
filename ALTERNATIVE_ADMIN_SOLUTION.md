# üîê Alternative Solution: Admin Login Issue

## Problem
The admin account password isn't working with "admin123".

## ‚úÖ Solution Options

### **Option 1: Try Alternative Passwords in Postman**

Keep everything the same, but try these passwords:

1. `Admin@123`
2. `Admin123`  
3. `password`
4. `admin@123`
5. `hospital123`

### **Option 2: Check Backend Logs**

Look at your backend terminal where the server is running. When the server started, it might have logged the admin credentials.

### **Option 3: Use MongoDB Compass**

If you have MongoDB Compass installed:

1. Connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`
2. Open `hospital_management` database
3. Open `users` collection
4. Find the document where `"role": "ADMIN"`
5. You can see if the password field exists
6. You can manually update the password hash

### **Option 4: Create New Admin via Registration**

Try registering a new admin account:

**Postman Request:**
```
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "firstName": "Super",
  "lastName": "Admin",
  "email": "superadmin@hospital.com",
  "password": "SuperAdmin123",
  "phone": "+27123456789",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

Then login with:
```json
{
  "email": "superadmin@hospital.com",
  "password": "SuperAdmin123"
}
```

### **Option 5: Add Doctors Without Admin (Workaround)**

Since you have facility IDs and know the structure, I can create a script that adds doctors directly through the backend without needing login.

Let me create that script for you...
