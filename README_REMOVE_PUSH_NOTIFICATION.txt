# Push Notification Service File Removed

The file `src/services/pushNotificationService.js` has been deleted because push notifications are not implemented in this version and all references to it have been removed from the codebase. If you plan to add push notification functionality in the future, you can restore or recreate this file as needed.

## Next Steps
- All notification-related code now shows a toast message instead.
- No runtime errors related to missing notification exports should occur.
- Update documentation or UI as needed to reflect this change.

If you need to re-implement notifications, consider using Firebase Cloud Messaging or another service and document the integration steps here.
